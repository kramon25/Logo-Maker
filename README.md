Description:

This application was built as a way to allow freelance web developers to create simple logos, for clients/projects so that they can skip the process of paying a graphic designer. It utilizes inquirer to prompt the user within the command line for how they would like their logo to look, the color of that text/shape of their logo, whether it be triangle, square or circle, as well as the color of that shape. Once the user has answered all prompts, then an SVG file is written using their selections to generate a logo.
